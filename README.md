**Crowded Aperture Variability Extraction**
Developing methods to extract and remove intrumental noise from crowded aperture *K2* exoplanet targets. Current scripts in development: 
 - aperturefit.py: Crowding-defined apertures
 - psffit.py: PSF fitting and bright neighbor subtraction
 - intrapix.py: Mathematical model for two-dimensional Gaussian PSF with covariance and inter-pixel sensitivity variation
